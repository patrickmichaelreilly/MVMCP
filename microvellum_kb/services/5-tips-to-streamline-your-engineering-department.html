   Your engineering
   department plays a vital role in ensuring your production runs smoothly. These
   five tips will help you improve the efficiencies of your design engineers and
   drafters.
  
<br></p>

<h2 class="toc_anchors" id="Take_the_Time_to_Make_It_Right">
     Take the Time to Make It Right
  
<br></h2>

<p>As an engineer, you are constantly watching
   the clock and responding to change requests. This pressure can lead many people
   to rush through projects, often missing the finer details or making mistakes
   along the way. If you slow down and allow take time to make it right from the
   start, you will realize that your work actually gets completed faster.</p>

<p>Take the time to engineer products so that the appropriate machining, hardware and assembly drawings are built into your process upfront, rather than leaving it to your factory to sort out. Microvellum's Toolbox software, an AutoCAD-based design for manufacturing platform, provides users with the flexibility to engineer intelligent products that can parametrically respond to user input to include every detail needed for production.</p>

<h2 class="toc_anchors" id="Communicate_With_Your_Team">
     Communicate With Your Team<br></h2>

<p>
   It’s important for
   your CAD engineering team to create a positive relationship with the builders
   in the shop, rather than having an “office vs. shop” mentality.&nbsp; Consider
   bringing your shop team’s opinion into your engineering process.&nbsp; Your
   builders can help your engineers design products that are easy to build.
  
<br></p>

<p>
   An engineer should always establish the
   initial idea of how products are to be designed but should seek the shop's approval
   to ensure that what they’ve designed will flow smoothly through the machining and
   assembly process. This helps build a strong relationship between the two
   departments and allows a teamwork mentality to grow within the business.&nbsp;
   Communication reduces rework struggles and stress.&nbsp; When engineers and
   builders work as a team, the mistakes tend to get fixed quickly because they
   are looking for a solution rather than spending time determining who made
   the mistake or placing blame.

<br></div>

<h2 class="toc_anchors" id="Examine_Your_Workflows">
   Examine Your Workflows
  
<br></h2>

<p>
   An engineer's job goes
   beyond the initial work related to developing a product, or maintaining catalogs
   or libraries of products. Your job as an engineer is also to help save time
   when it comes to the production and manufacturing of the products.
  
<br></p>

<p>
   One way to determine or measure an efficiency
   improvement may be to calculate the specific units or individual tasks related
   to accomplishing a task and try to minimize the overall total. For example, is your CNC operator spending time writing manual programs at your CNC
   machine?&nbsp;<span>If so, they could be
   wasting valuable time that could be spent in other areas of production. </span><br></p><div><span>Have
   you thought about the total number of applications you have in place to
   accomplish your overall goal of getting a project out for delivery?&nbsp;</span><span>Far too often, companies we talk to are bogged
   down by their process and have accumulated multiple channels to drive their
   production. Minimizing your touchpoints will drastically improve your
   production, allowing for more throughput in your operation and engineering.</span></div>

<h2 class="toc_anchors" id="Invest_in_Your_Team">
    Invest in Your Team
  
<br></h2>

<p>
  <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford">
        Henry Ford
  </a>
     &nbsp;once said, “The only thing that is worse than training
     your employees and having them leave is not training them and having them
     stay." Your engineering team plays a vital role in your overall production.
     Allowing your team to get out of touch or stagnate can cause serious problems.
     Successful business owners recognize this and invest in their team, seeking out
     training opportunities wherever they may exist. Take part in webinars, user
     group experiences, factory tours, and education to ensure your team has the
     knowledge they need to be successful.</p>

<h2 class="toc_anchors" id="Maintain_a_Standard_Operating_Procedure">
     Maintain a Standard Operating Procedure
  
<br></h2>

<p>
     Once you have your engineering and production
     process in place, share it with all departments and personnel. Maintaining an
     active Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) will allow you to systematically
     evaluate performance goals and identify areas for improvement much quicker.
     When onboarding new employees, you will find that their on-the-job
     satisfaction is much higher when they have a documented procedure for success.
